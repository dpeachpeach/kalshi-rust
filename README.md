# kalshi-rust

## Rust Wrapper for the Kalshi trading API

This is a wrapper for the [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/) trading API written by and for those using Rust. 
This wrapper is asynchronous and typically more performant than the official Python API provided by the developers, presented here: [*KalshiDevAPI*](https://github.com/Kalshi/kalshi-python).

## Documentation
Read the fully-featured docs [here](https://docs.rs/kalshi/0.9.0/kalshi/) and check the project out on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/kalshi/0.9.0).

## Sample Bot

The Sample Bot directory is an example script that completes all the tasks required to obtain advanced API access from the developers.

## Featurelist + Roadmap

### HTTP Requests: ✅ 
As of now the project supports interacting with Kalshi's RESTful API **fully**.
The only features missing from that part of the project are as follows:
- Advanced API features (Waiting for the devs to give me access)

However any user of this library can build a rust trading bot using this library 
if they wish!

Every function present in the library wraps around the [Kalshi Trading API](https://trading-api.readme.io/reference/getting-started).
