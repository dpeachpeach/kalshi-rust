# kalshi-rust

## Rust Wrapper for the Kalshi trading API

This is a wrapper for the [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/) trading API written by and for those using Rust. 

## Featurelist / Roadmap

### WIP Statement
As of now this project is a **Work in Progress**, this means the feature list is not complete. Anyone is welcome to try out the API as they see fit. A sample implementation is present in the *test_dir* directory for testing and I will develop a full arbitrage 'sample bot' at the conclusion of the project for anyone to edit / mess around with should they want to start using the API.

### Project Goals
1. Complete every function that wraps around the [Kalshi Trading API}(https://trading-api.readme.io/reference/getting-started).
2. Work on an implementation for websockets (Stretch goal at the moment).
3. Write detailed documentation.
4. Write sample_bot that utilizes basic price arbitrage.
