//! An HTTPS and Websocket wrapper that allows users to write trading bots for the [Kalshi events trading platform](https://kalshi.com).
//!
//! kalshi-rust is asynchronous, performant, and succint. Dash past verbose and annoying HTTPS requests
//! and use this wrapper to quickly write blazingly fast trading bots in Rust!
//!
//! As of version 0.9.0, HTTPS features are fully complete but websocket support and advanced API access features are not complete.
//! If you'd like to keep up on kalshi-rust's development, report bugs, or view a sample trading script,
//! feel free to visit the [github](https://github.com/dpeachpeach/kalshi-rust)!
//! A star would also be greatly appreciated, I'm a student developer writing this for free and any recognition is incredibly helpful!
//!
//! ## The Kalshi Struct
//!
//! The [Kalshi](Kalshi) struct is the central component of this crate.
//! All authentication, order routing, market requests, and position snapshots are handled through the struct and its methods.
//!
//! For more details, see [Kalshi](Kalshi).
//!
//! For a quick tutorial / beginners guide, jump [here](#quick-start-guide).
//!
//! ### Initializing the Kalshi struct in demo mode.
//! ```
//! use kalshi::Kalshi;
//! use kalshi::TradingEnvironment;
//!
//! let kalshi_instance = Kalshi::new(TradingEnvironment::DemoMode);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Quick Start Guide
//!
//! First, list the Kalshi struct as a dependency in your crate.
//!
//! ```toml
//! kalshi = { version = "0.9"}
//! ```
//!
//! Initialize the Kalshi Struct and login using your authentication details:
//! - **IMPORTANT**:  A user's authentication token expires every thirty minutes, this means
//! that you'll need to call the login function every thirty minutes in order to
//! ensure that you remain authenticated with a valid token.
//! - Storing user / password information in plaintext is not recommended,
//! an implementation of extracting user details from local environmental variables
//! is available [here](https://github.com/dpeachpeach/kalshi-rust/blob/main/sample_bot/src/main.rs#L12)
//! ```
//! use kalshi::Kalshi;
//! use kalshi::TradingEnvironment;
//!
//! let username = "johndoe@example.com";
//! let password = "example_password";
//!
//! let mut kalshi_instance = Kalshi::new(TradingEnvironment::DemoMode);
//!
//! kalshi_instance.login(username, password).await?;
//! ```
//!
//! After logging in, you can call any method present in the crate without issue.
//! Here is a script that buys a 'yes' contract on November 13th's New York temperature
//! market.
//!
//! ```
//! let new_york_ticker = "HIGHNY-23NOV13-T51".to_string();
//!
//! let bought_order = kalshi_instance
//!     .create_order(
//!     kalshi::Action::Buy,
//!     None,
//!     1,
//!     kalshi::Side::Yes,
//!     new_york_ticker,
//!     kalshi::OrderType::Limit,
//!     None,
//!     None,
//!     None,
//!     None,
//!     Some(5)).await.unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Refer to the rest of the documentation for details on all other methods!
//! All methods found in the [kalshi API documentation](https://trading-api.readme.io/reference/getting-started) are wrapped around in this crate.
//!
//! ## Returned Values
//!
//! Whenever a user makes a method call using the kalshi struct, data is typically returned
//! in structs that encapsulate the json fields returned by the server. All data
//! in the structs is owned so a user can access the attributes without issue.
//!
//! ### Examples:
//!
//! #### Obtaining the Exchange's current status
//! Returns a struct that represents whether trading or the exchange are currently active.
//! ```
//! use kalshi::Kalshi;
//! use kalshi::TradingEnvironment;
//! let kalshi_instance = Kalshi::new(TradingEnvironment::DemoMode);
//!
//! kalshi_instance.get_exchange_status().await.unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! #### Obtaining 5 miscellaneous market events
//! Returns a vector of 'event' structs and a cursor.
//! ```
//! use kalshi::Kalshi;
//! use kalshi::TradingEnvironment;
//! let kalshi_instance = Kalshi::new(TradingEnvironment::DemoMode);
//!
//! kalshi_instance.get_multiple_events(Some(5), None, None, None, None).await.unwrap();
//! ```
//! #### Checking the User's balance
//! Returns an i64 representing the user's balance in cents.
//! ```
//! use kalshi::Kalshi;
//! use kalshi::TradingEnvironment;
//! let kalshi_instance = Kalshi::new(TradingEnvironment::DemoMode);
//!
//! kalshi_instance.get_balance();
//! ```
//!
